Draggable and resizable
------------------------

This zeptojs plugin written in a few lines of coffescript will allow any 
object to be resizable and draggable, just like jquery ui does, using html5 
and with much less code, as the rest of the simpleHtml5Stuffs this has no 
bullshit, nothing that is useless nor compatibility layers.
